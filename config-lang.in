# NEIS is a special front end.  From a user's perspective it is not
# really a language, but a middle end feature.  However, the GIMPLE
# reading module is implemented as a front end, so enabling NEIS means
# enabling this "language". To enable NEIS functionality, use
# --enable-neis when configuring the compiler.

# Add NEIS to boot language if it is enabled.
